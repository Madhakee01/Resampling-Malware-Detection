## Exploring the Impact of Resampling Methods forMalware Detection

This repository has all the code used in the experiments carried out in the paper *"Exploring the Impact of Resampling Methods for Malware Detection"* [1].


This repository is organized as follows:

* **Code** folder - contains the code for reproducing the experiments presented in the paper;
* **Data** folder - contains information regarding the used data set.


### Requirements

The experimental design was implemented in R language. Both code and data are in a format suitable for R environment.

In order to replicate these experiments you will need a working installation
  of R. Check [https://www.r-project.org/] if you need to download and install it.

In your R installation you also need to install the following additional R packages:

  - performaceEstimation
  - UBL
  - rpart
  - nnet
  - gbm


All the above packages can be installed from CRAN Repository directly as any "normal" R package. Essentially you need to issue the following command within R:

```r
install.packages(c("performanceEstimation", "UBL", "rpart", "nnet", "gbm"))
```


Check the other README files in each folder to see more detailed instructions on how to run the experiments.
