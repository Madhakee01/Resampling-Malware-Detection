## Reproducing the Paper Experiments

## Contents

  This folder contains  all code that is necessary to replicate the
  experiments reported in the paper *"Exploring the Impact of Resampling Methods for Malware Detection"* [1]

  The folder contains the following files:

  - **ExpsNSL-KDD.R** the main script for obtaining the results of the resampling strategies presented in the paper

  - **EstPredTasks.R** the script with auxiliary functions for defining the estimation tasks
  
  - **Auxs.R** the script with auxiliary functions for defining the workflows and the evaluation procedure

  - **README.md** this file

## Necessary Software

To replicate these experiments you will need a working installation
  of R. Check [https://www.r-project.org/] if you need to download and install it.

In your R installation you also need to install the following additional R packages:

  - performanceEstimation
  - UBL
  - rpart
  - nnet
  - gbm


  All the above packages can be installed from CRAN Repository directly as any "normal" R package. Essentially you need to issue the following command within R:

```r
install.packages(c("performanceEstimation", "UBL", "rpart", "nnet", "gbm"))
```

The implementation of the resampling strategies used in the paper are contained in UBL package. You should install UBL with version 0.07 or higher to guarantee that these strategies are available in the package.



## Running the experiences:

  Before running the experiments you need to load the data sets used in R. 
  After having the necessary data set, to run the experiments described in the paper you execute R in the folder with the code and then issue the command:
  
```r
source("ExpsNSL-KDD.R")
```

Alternatively, you may run the experiments directly from a Linux terminal
  (useful if you want to logout because some experiments take a long
  time to run):

```bash
nohup R --vanilla --quiet < ExpsNSL-KDD.R &
```

## Running a subset of the experiences:

  Given that the experiments take  long time to run, you may be interested in running only a partial set of experiments. To do this you must edit the ExpsNSL-KDD.R file. 
  
  Lets say, for instance, that you want to change the number and/or the values of the learning algorithms parameters. To achieve this edit the *WFs* list in lines 30 to 32. For instance, if you only want to run the experiments for the gbm learner but with more values for the n.trees parameter, you should add the values you want in the n.trees. Line 32 could be changed as follows:
  
```r
 WFs$gbm <- list(learner.pars=list(n.trees = c(100,200, 300, 400, 500), 
									interaction.depth = c(1), 
									shrinkage = c(0.1)))
```

After making all the necessary changes run the experiments as previously explained.
